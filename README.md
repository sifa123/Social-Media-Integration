# Social-Media-Integration

It was my third task in **The Sparks Foundation** as a **Web Development & Designing Intern**. Here I have to make a simple responsive website where user can login through at least
two social media from such as Facebook and Google. After login user can see their details like name, email, picture etc. In that case no backend or server side programming required.
